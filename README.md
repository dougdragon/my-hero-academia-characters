# my-hero-academia-characters
My daughter is into _My Hero Academia_ and after finding an API that lists the characters, I decided to make a page that lists them all.

# Tools used
- [My Hero Academia API](https://myheroacademiaapi.com/docs) for the data
- [GridJS](https://gridjs.io/docs/index) for the table

# To see the page
- Locally: After cloning this repo, just open up the `index.html` file in your browser
- GitHub Pages: [https://dougdragon.github.io/my-hero-academia-characters](https://dougdragon.github.io/my-hero-academia-characters)
